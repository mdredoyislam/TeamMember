Shortcode Attributes:

number: The number of team members to display. Default is 3.
img_pos: The position of the image (top or bottom). Default is top.
see_all: Whether to display the 'See All' button. Default is true.
Query: A WP_Query is used to fetch the specified number of team members.

Templates: Two templates are defined based on the img_pos attribute to position the image either at the top or bottom.

Output Buffering: The output is buffered and returned as the shortcode output.

'See All' Button: The button is conditionally displayed based on the see_all attribute.
